You may add any event detection function that you like here and it will be incorporated into the scope menu if it meets the following criteria:
1) When passed no inputs the function must return a character array that describes the type of events it generates.
2) The function must take the two inputs (dataTrace, timePerPoint) where:
	dataTrace is the values of a channel over time
	timePerPoint is the time in ms per data point
3) The funciton must return a vector of events times that are in units of points.

Example:
function eventTimes = highSpots(dataTrace, timePerPoint)
% look for places where the dataTrace stays above 0 for 1 ms

	if nargin == 0
		% return the event type if no inputs given
		eventTimes = 'High Spots';
	else
		% return events
		pointsPerMs = (1/timePerPoint);

		% create a logical array of trues
		eventTimes = ones(length(dataTrace) - (pointsPerMs - 1), 1) == 1;

		for i = 1:pointsPerMs % run through a ms worth of points
		    eventTimes = eventTimes & (dataTrace((0:end - pointsPerMs) + i) > 0);
		end

		% only return the ones
		eventTimes = find(eventTimes);
	end
