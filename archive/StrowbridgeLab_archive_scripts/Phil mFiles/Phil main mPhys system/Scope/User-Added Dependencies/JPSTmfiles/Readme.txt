To use the pc JPSTH system:

(1) start MATLAB, and cd to the mfiles subdirectory

(2) type "JPST" on the MATLAB command line.

(3) specify the data file and adjust the various parameter constants.
Some test data are provided in the "data" subdirectory. Try
"s62abc.gdf". Explore the "Display" options (main window).


NOTE: 

 This JPSTH version is an adaptation of our original Unix-Fortran
version and was developed on Windows98 and MATLAB 5.3; we do NOT know
how it will perform in other Windows, NT, Linux or MATLAB 6.x.)
