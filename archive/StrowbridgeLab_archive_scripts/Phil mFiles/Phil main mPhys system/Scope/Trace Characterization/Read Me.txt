You may add any trace characterization function that you like here and it will be incorporated into the scope menu if it meets the following criteria:
1) When passed no inputs the function must return a character array that describes the type of analysis it generates.
2) The function must take the four inputs (dataTrace, timePerPoint, startTime, axisHandle) where:
	dataTrace is the values of a channel over time
	timePerPoint is the time in ms per data point
    	startTime is the time in ms of the first point in dataTrace
    	axisHandle is the graphics handle for the axis from which the data came
3) The funciton may return a value that will be displayed.
