Functions in this folder are for characterizing episodes.  This menu appears in the right panel of the file browser and passes a cell array of file names to its functions representing all currently selected episodes.  The requirements of functions in this folder are only that the return a string if no inputs are passed (this string is their title in the menu) and that they do something else when passed the file names.  For example:


function outText = displayFileNames(fileNames)

    if ~nargin
        outText = 'Names';
        return
    end
       
    for i = 1:numel(fileNames)
	disp(fileNames{i});
    end
